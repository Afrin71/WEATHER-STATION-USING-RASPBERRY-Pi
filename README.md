# WEATHER-STATION-USING-RASPBERRY-Pi
I have made Weather Station using DHT11 Humidity Temperature Sensor &amp; Raspberry Pi Pico. In this project, the ambient temperature value and humidity value are monitored in real-time through the DHT11 Temperature &amp; Humidity sensor and displayed on the 16Ã—2 I2C LCD module synchronously.
